# Anomaly_Detection

This repository contains jupyter notebook of the Anomaly Detection project that I did.

# Algorithm implemented :

- Cluster based anomaly detection (K-mean)
- Repartition of data into categories then Gaussian/Elliptic Enveloppe on each categories separately
- Markov Chain
- Isolation Forest
- One class SVM
- RNN (comparison between prediction and reality)
